         <p>So as most of you know, I am Luk4 or Luk4Luk4 when I'm feeling fancy. I'm the weird looking kid with the red jacket right there. 
           And right now, I am in a rage so I am going to go absolutely bonkers here. Some of you who don't know me may be asking these questions right now.<br><br>"Defcon?"<br><br>"Are you a hacker?"
          <br><br>"Can you fix my PC?"<br><br>The answers are go to defcon.org if you wanna learn because I'm not good at explaining things, yes but I certainly don't feel like it right now, and heck no I don't have the time or skills for that. 
           I'm basically a kid with self doubts, a love for all things computers, and too much free time. <br>Anyway enough with the passive aggressive rage...</p>
         <p>I discovered defcon a couple months ago and fell absolutely in love. A community of hackers just seemed so special to me. It was a dream come true for a kid who couldn't socialize.
           So here I am, waiting in linecon.</p><br>
         <p>The last frew days have been... an adjustment, to say the least. I'm meeting a lot of new people and adjusting to a culture I've never realy interacted with that much.
           There's also the complete lack of knowledge at my part as well. Though I know that it's okay to not know everything, there's this burning want in me to know more. That want can lead to trouble, to say the least</p><br>
         <p> As for today, I'd say it's pretty boring. We talked about making a goatse emote (bad idea), and in general just really random dumb stuff.</p>
